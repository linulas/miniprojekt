# Cards

This is a small schoolproject I made in spring 2018, it's just the basic structure of a progressive web application, nothing of production quality. The app can search through cards from Magic the Gathering developers, store them in cache with fallback content, and supports install on local device.

## Prerequisites

A webserver, I just used chrome webserver.

## To think about

Remember to clear cache storage from time to time since management of cache size is ont implemented.
